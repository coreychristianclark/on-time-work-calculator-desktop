Obtaining enough sleep in our daily life is absolutely crucial to not only our wellbeing, but our mental clarity as well. Too many people either take their sleep for granted, or don't plan accordingly to ensure they get enough of it. Functioning at peak performance becomes a challenging obstacle when you're low on sleep and feeling physically and mentally sluggish, torpid, and lethargic.

In my role as an electrician, a frequent challenge is the need to switch between various job sites with different locations, start times, and shifts -- often within the same week or even daily. When I get such news, my very first question is, "What does my bedtime have to be tonight in order to get the desired hours of sleep I need to function at peak performance? Let me check where the location is, how far it is from my place, how long it'll take to get there, what time I have to wake up in the morning to get there with 15-20min grace," and so forth. It's a lot of calculating, and I've been doing it on paper for years, which isn't the most fun activity. Not to mention the amount of time I waste double and triple-checking the math.

To remedy this issue and help others who may suffer from the same conditions, I decided to make a calculator that does all of this for you in one go. Just type in the needed information and let the calculator do the rest -- and all of the numbers are on-screen for you to check over, versus recollecting the numbers in your head numerous times.

My goal with this project was to create a one-stop shop for all of these factors. In just one screen, you can do not only all of the required math, but you can view your route on the integrated map, and even zoom in to get a street view of the surrounding area, eliminating the need for dry drives.

This single source aims to save you time, money, resources, and sleep.
